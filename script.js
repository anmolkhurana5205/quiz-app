// so for this i have to create a array of questions with their respective options and i should also assign another attribute to each option which tell that this option is correct or not ?

// what functions i should create ?
// funtion which execute after clicking start button startGame().
// setNextQuestion () this is used to set which question from the question array will be the next question.
// showQuestion () this is used to show the selected question.
// function which execute after clicking next button setNextQuestion (), showQuestion ().
// function which execute after clicking any option selectAnswer() and in this i also need to check whether the questions are finished or not ?.
